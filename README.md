# Hospital Management Dashboard – Power BI Project
This Power BI project features a comprehensive Hospital Management Dashboard that provides actionable insights into various aspects of hospital operations, patient care, doctor performance, finances, and inventory management. The dashboard transforms complex healthcare data into interactive visualizations, enabling hospital administrators, medical staff, and financial teams to make informed, data-driven decisions. 

Built using SQL Server, SSIS, Power BI, and Power Query, this Hospital Management Dashboard offers in-depth insights into patient activities, doctor performance, financial metrics, medical tests, medicine inventory, and patient feedback. All of this information is presented in a professional, interactive Power BI report.

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies Used

1. Power BI – for interactive dashboards and data visualizations
2. SQL Server – for structured database storage and management
3. SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) – for importing and automating data loading
4. Power Query – for cleaning, merging, and transforming raw datasets
5 DAX – for calculated measures and KPIs
6. Excel / CSV files – as original data sources

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide a 360° view of hospital performance by consolidating data from various departments. From patient profiling to financial health, it offers detailed KPIs, trends, and operational insights — helping stakeholders optimize resources, monitor outcomes, and improve care quality.

## 📁 Project Structure
This project contains 7 professional report pages, each targeting a different operational area of hospital analytics:

1. Summary Page
Provides a high-level overview of hospital operations, including active patients and doctors, total surgeries and appointments, overall revenue, and gender distribution. It also highlights trends in patient visits and revenue over time to offer an immediate health check of the hospital.

2. Patient Profile Page
Focuses on patient-specific metrics such as total visits, surgeries, total billing amount, and satisfaction ratings. It enables analysis of demographics, location-based insights, and patient-wise appointment history, helping personalize care delivery and monitor patient engagement.

3. Doctor Performance Page
Evaluates doctor-wise performance by showcasing KPIs like total appointments conducted, surgeries done, revenue generated, average satisfaction ratings, and total experience. Visuals include doctor-wise patient volume, revenue trends, and activity tracking for performance analysis.

4. Department Analysis Page
Analyzes department-level operations including total doctors, revenue, surgeries, and satisfaction score per department. It highlights the most active and highest-performing departments to optimize staffing and resource allocation.

5. Financial Overview Page
