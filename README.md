# Hospital Management Dashboard – Power BI Project
This Power BI project features a comprehensive Hospital Management Dashboard that provides actionable insights into various aspects of hospital operations, patient care, doctor performance, finances, and inventory management. The dashboard transforms complex healthcare data into interactive visualizations, enabling hospital administrators, medical staff, and financial teams to make informed, data-driven decisions. 

Built using SQL Server, SSIS, Power BI, and Power Query, this Hospital Management Dashboard offers in-depth insights into patient activities, doctor performance, financial metrics, medical tests, medicine inventory, and patient feedback. All of this information is presented in a professional, interactive Power BI report.
